<h3 class="h3head"><a id="Page_29"></a>NOTES ON THE SELF-PRUNING OF TREES.</h3>

<h4 class="h4head"><span class="smcap">John H. Schaffner and Fred J. Tyler.</span></h4>

<p>In a dense forest of growing trees the smaller, side branches of
the main stem, as well as those of the larger branches, are continually
dying off. But the tree rids itself of these dead branches by
forming a collar of tissue from the cambium layer around the base
of the branch, which presses more tightly as layer after layer of living
wood is added, until the branch finally falls off and the hole which
is left is grown over in a short time. This process is known as
natural pruning. But the process which we wish to consider is
very different from this, and we desire to distinguish it by the term,
self-pruning. In this case the living branches are cut off or else the
cutting-off process is the cause of the death of the branch. A
special adaptation is provided to accomplish the result and the process
is one whose purpose is the shedding of the branches rather
than the attempt to accommodate the plant to conditions of injury
brought about by other causes. In a number of species perfectly
formed winter buds were developed on the branches which were
shed, and so far as our observations go, the twigs are cast in the
fall and winter.</p>

<p>Although the shedding of branches is well known, especially in
the conifers, not as much notice has been taken of it as we think it
deserves. We have been taking observations for several years and
have been partly anticipated by Dr. Bessey in a note in <i>Science</i> 12.
650, 1900,—Botanical Notes—The Annual Shedding of Cottonwood
Twigs. Bessey describes the shedding of the twigs of Populus
deltoides as occurring about the middle of October, and after giving
the details of the process, concludes as follows: “It is an interesting
fact that the Tamarisks (Tamarix sp.) which are held by some
botanists to be closely related to the Poplars, shed their twigs by
exactly the same device as that described above. In the Tamarisks
the shedding of the twigs is a part of the annual process of defoliation,
their leaves being so small that it appears to be less trouble
and expense to drop twig and all than to separate every individual
leaf. Possibly in the Cottonwoods, with their large leaves, we have
a survival of the Tamarisk twig-shedding habit long after its
original significance has disappeared.” Dr. Bessey, however, we
believe, will not insist on this supposition when he considers that
the same thing occurs in species of Prunus, Quercus, and other
widely separated genera.</p>

<p class="captionleft"><span class="smcap">Fig. 4</span>—Green twig of Ampelopsis cordata, showing joints (<i>a</i>) at the leaf nodes.</p>
</div><!--end figcenter-->

<p class="p2">The self-pruning of twigs from woody stems, so far as our
observations go at present, is accomplished in three general ways:
1st, by the formation of a single joint close to the parent branch;
2nd, by the formation of a brittle zone near the base of the limbs
which are to be shed; 3rd, by a series of transverse joints corresponding
to the leaf nodes.</p>

<p>Among the plants which come in the first class, the most
striking perhaps, is Populus alba, in which very large branches are
frequently cut off in such a perfect manner that one might think the
pruning had been done with a sharp knife. Green twigs from one to
fifteen years old were found to be shed and no doubt still older ones
are cut off. The twigs have well-developed winter buds and this is
also the case in other species of Populus and in certain species of
Quercus and Prunus. In Quercus alba shed twigs were found from
one to four years old while in Q. acuminata there were some seven
years of age. In Prunus serotina twigs from one to six years old
were cut off. In Ulmus Americana not only are joints formed at
the base of the twigs, but the twigs also break apart at the nodes,
caused by annual growth.</p>

<p>The following species were found belonging to the first class:</p>

<ul>
<li>Populus alba L.</li>
<li><span style="margin-left: 1em;">“&#160; &#160;  deltoides Marsh.</span></li>
<li><span style="margin-left: 1em;">“&#160; &#160;  grandidentata Mx.</span></li>
<li><span style="margin-left: 1em;">“&#160; &#160;  tremuloides Mx.</span></li>
<li><span style="margin-left: 1em;">“&#160; &#160;  dilatata Ait.</span></li>
<li>Quercus alba L.</li>
<li><span style="margin-left: 1em;">“&#160; &#160;  robur L.</span></li>
<li><span style="margin-left: 1em;">“&#160; &#160;  macrocarpa Mx.</span></li>
<li><span style="margin-left: 1em;">“&#160; &#160;  acuminata (Mx.) Sarg.</span></li>
<li>Ulmus americana, L.</li>
<li>Prunus serotina, Ehrh.</li>
<li>Tamarix gallica L.</li>
<li>Tsuga canadensis (L.) Carr.</li>
</ul>

<p>All the plants found with brittle zones belonged to the willows.
It is interesting to note that the branches shed may be one to
several years of age and that certain branches do not develop a
brittle zone. Salix nigra and S. amygdaloides seem to show the
character most perfectly and it is remarkable to see how readily the
branches drop off.</p>

<p>The following species show the adaptation:</p>

<ul>
<li>Salix nigra Marsh.</li>
<li><span style="margin-left: 1em;">“&#160;  amygdaloides anders.</span></li>
<li><span style="margin-left: 1em;">“&#160;  fragilis L.</span></li>
<li><span style="margin-left: 1em;">“&#160;  alba vitellina (L.) Koch.</span></li>
<li><span style="margin-left: 1em;">“&#160;  babylonica L.</span></li>
</ul>

<p>Among those which come in the third class, the most remarkable
plant observed was Ampelopsis cordata. About the time that
the leaves are shed nearly all the slender green branches literally
fall to pieces and drop off. Most of the fruit is on these branches
and the berries are thus shed at the same time. In the winter the
plant is remarkable for the few branches left and it looks like an
artificially pruned vine.</p>

<p>The species observed belonging to this class are the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Ampelopsis cordata Mx.</li>
<li><span style="margin-left: 2em;">“&#160; &#160; &#160; tricuspidata Seib. &amp; Zucc.</span></li>
<li>Parthenocissus quinquefolia (L.) Planch.</li>
</ul>

<p>The shedding of the twigs of woody plants may in many cases
be entirely an adaptation to get rid of the leaves as in the case of the
dwarf branches of Pines and the young twigs of Tamarisks. But
even in the Tamarisks it is doubtful whether the joints formed in the
older branches can be claimed to have such a purpose, since in this
case the leaves have all been shed with the annual twigs. The
shedding of the old woody branches may have a different purpose.
In regard to the trees mentioned above, we think that the process is
one primarily to rid the tree of surplus branches. This would manifestly
be an advantage and would give room and opportunity for
the development of many young leafy shoots every year without
accumulating too great a mass of useless members. This is certainly
the case with the poplars and the willows. In no case do we
think it admissible to say that the adaptation is primarily for the purpose
of propagation, although this may be a very important incidental
result in such plants as the willows when growing in wet
places. In the case of Ampelopsis cordata, the only reasonable explanation
seems to be a preparation for the winter condition, since
the branches which are shed do not ripen and the plant has an admirable
method for shedding its leaves. The slender branches
would be in great danger of being killed by the cold of winter. The
shedding of the young branches of Taxodium distichum (L.) Rich. is
remarkably like that in Tamarix. The slender, dwarf branches
clothed with the leaves drop off in the fall or the following spring.
The habit must be quite ancient, as such branches of Taxodium
distichum miocenum Hr. are very abundantly preserved as fossils.
In Taxodium mexicanum Carr. the dwarf branches are not shed
until the second year. Glyptostrobus pendulus Endl. and G. heterophyllus
Endl. also have deciduous dwarf branches. There are other
conifers and no doubt many other angiospermous trees which
possess these interesting adaptations and by careful observations, no
doubt many interesting ecological facts will be brought to light.</p>

<h3 class="h3head"><a id="Page_33"></a>PLANT NAMES COMMEMORATIVE OF OHIO BOTANISTS.</h3>

<h4 class="h4head"><span class="smcap">Clara Armstrong.</span></h4>

<p class="p2">Though Ohio has had fewer botanists than many other States,
some of these became known wherever botany was cultivated.
Riddell was one of the pioneer botanists of the west and for six years
he was a resident of this State. By the publication of his <i>Synopsis</i>
he contributed largely to Ohio Botany. The names of Sullivant and
Lesquereux shed still greater luster on our state. Most of the work
of the former and all of that of the latter was done in Ohio. Several
others whose names are given below have been industrious students
of our Flora, and have spent many years if not all their lives within
our territory. It is a long and interesting list of botanical names
which commemorates their scientific labors. In the preparation of
this paper I have been aided materially by Prof. W. A. Kellerman.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John Leonard Riddell.</span>—Born in Leyden, Mass., Feb. 20th, 1807;
died in New Orleans, La., Oct. 7, 1863. He graduated from Rensseler
Institute, Troy, N. Y. He came to Ohio in 1830 and became professor
of Botany and adjunct Professor of Chemistry in the Medical College
of Cincinnati. He was an enthusiastic and industrious botanist, and
collected extensively in many parts of our State. Scarcely any of
his specimens seem now to be in <a id="chg1"></a>existence though he prepared sets
for sale and accumulated a large herbarium. His most important
publication was the Synopsis of the Flora of the Western States.
He also published a Supplementary Catalogue of Ohio Plants. In
1836 he left Ohio, carrying his botanical specimens to New Orleans
where he became professor in a Medical College; he was also in the
employ of the government until his death. He furnished many notes
and longer articles to scientific journals and was the author of many
new species of plants. The following have been named in his honor:</p>

<ul>
<li>Riddellia, synonym of Psilostrophe, a genus of the Compositae family.</li>
<li>Solidago Riddellii, a species of Golden Rod.</li>
<li>Senecio Riddellii, synonym of S. Douglasii, a species of Compositae.</li>
</ul>

<p><span class="smcap">William Starling Sullivant.</span>—Born in Franklinton, Ohio,
Jan. 18, 1803, died in Columbus, Ohio, April 30, 1873. He was educated
at Ohio University and Yale. The death of his father at the
time of his graduation prevented him from studying for one of the
learned professions and he became a surveyor and practical engineer,
which occupation he followed until late in life. During this time he
collected and studied the plants of central Ohio, and in 1840 he began
to pay particular attention to Mosses; this became the subject of his
special study, and he was soon recognized as the most eminent bryologist
that this country has ever produced.</p>

<p>In 1864 the degree of LL.D. was conferred on Sullivant by Gambier
College. He was elected to membership in many scientific societies
both in the United States and Europe. At his death his bryological
books, collections and preparations of Mosses were given to the Gray
Herbarium of Harvard University. The remainder of his botanical
library was bequeathed to the Ohio State University then called the
Agricultural and Mechanical College. His microscopes were given
to Starling Medical College. Of this institution he was senior trustee.
He was the author of many new species and the plants named for
him by other botanists are as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>Sullivantia, a genus of the Saxifrages. The name first proposed
by Gray (1840) for the species discovered by Sullivant was
Saxifraga Sullivantii; two years later Gray established the
genus Sullivantia and published the name of the plant in
question as Sullivantia Ohionis. According to the rules of
priority that name now stands as Sullivantia Sullivantii.</li>

<p><span class="smcap">Leo Lesquereux.</span>—Born in Fleurier, Switzerland, Nov. 18,
1806, died in Columbus, Ohio, Oct. 25, 1889. On entering the Academy
of Neuchatel he met Arnold Guyot and together they became devoted
to natural science. In 1822 he went to Eisenach preparatory
to entering the University of Berlin, supporting himself by teaching
French. He was principal of a college at Chaux de Fonds but had
to give this up on account of deafness. From this time he did
engraving, made watch springs, and studied Mosses and fossil
plants.</p>

<p>In 1848 Lesquereux came to America settling at Cambridge,
where he assisted Louis Agassiz; but he soon removed to Columbus,
Ohio, where he lived until his death. He was a worthy associate of
William S. Sullivant to whom in fact he was indebted by the most
commendable generosity. He was a paleo-botanist and a student of
Mosses. Many plants are named for him including a large number
of fossil forms.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John Strong Newberry.</span>—Born at Windsor, Conn., Dec. 22,
1822, died in New York, Dec. 7, 1892. He graduated from Western
Reserve College 1846 and from Cleveland Medical College 1848. He
studied abroad for two years and then practiced medicine in Cleveland
until 1855 when he was appointed acting Surgeon and Geologist
to an exploring expedition through the country between San Francisco
and the Columbia River. He went on several of these
expeditions studying the botanical, zoological, and geological
features of the country. In 1869 he was appointed Chief Geologist
to the Geological Survey of Ohio.</p>

<p>In 1859 Newberry published the first State Catalogue of Ohio
Plants. About 1865 he was made professor of Geology and palaeontology

<h3 class="h3head"><a id="Page_39"></a>THE MAXIMUM HEIGHT OF PLANTS. II.</h3>
<h4 class="h4head"><span class="smcap">John H. Schaffner.</span></h4>

<p>Last spring the writer published a few measurements of some
common western plants in the Asa Gray Bulletin (Vol. 8: 19-20). A few
other measurements are given below, all from Kansas except four
which are from Ohio. It would be well for all collectors to keep records
of the size of the plants which they meet, including measurements
of the height and also dimensions of the leaves, flowers, fruits
and underground parts. In this way the manual of the future may
be brought to represent more accurately the living plant as it grows
in nature rather than the dried, shrunken and dwarf specimens of
the herbarium.</p>

been thought advisable to republish the entire list, inserting the
additions in their proper places. The list below contains 137 species.
It is compiled from the records of the Wheaton Club, excepting
those species for which Prof. J. R. Taylor is given credit. Only
those species of which nests, eggs, or fledgelings have been observed
are reported as breeding. The names are preceded by the
A. O. U. check list number. Further additions will be published

<h3 class="h3head"><a id="Page_46"></a>MINOR PLANT NOTES. No. 1.</h3>
<h4 class="h4head"><span class="smcap">W. A. Kellerman.</span></h4>

<p>An introductory paragraph to this series may be short as will be
the notes that follow. Suffice therefore to say that from time to
time the field jottings and short notes of observations on the plants
of our State flora will be presented. Not only those made myself
but others which may be kindly communicated to me for this purpose
by botanists, amateurs, students and other observers will find
a place in the series. An especial invitation is extended to pupils in
our High Schools and to teachers throughout the State to contribute
suitable material which in many cases may be of great interest and
importance. Sub-heads will be used thus making it possible to scan
the notes easily.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Puccinia smilacis.</span>—This Black Rust which has the various
species of Green Briar for its host, was noticed in extraordinary
quantity the past season in Scioto, Adams and Brown Counties. It
was abundant only on Smilax glauca—called in that region the
Saw Brier—but not uncommonly occurred on S. hispida and S.
rotundifolia. It was also remarkable in this respect namely that
the teleutospores (the black or winter spores) were excessively
abundant: the uredospores (red or summer spores) could be found
only when search was made. The observation here recorded pertains
to the first half of the month of November. I have occasionally
noticed uredospores in quantity on Smilax leaves in the various parts
of Ohio but never before found the winter-spores common. It should
perhaps be added parenthetically that <i>Dicœoma</i> having the priority
over Puccinia is really the generic name that should be used, but the
commoner designation may here be tolerated.</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><a id="chg5"></a>Quercus acuminata.</span>—The Chestnut or Yellow Oak (name
in Gray’s Manual Quercus Muhlenbergii) is described as “a tall tree
with thin <i>flaky</i> bark” (Gray), or “a tree with gray <i>flaky</i> bark”
(Britton); and in fact many of the White Oaks are said to have
“<i>flaky</i>” bark. The Quercus acuminata is very abundant in central
Ohio and is of common occurrence in many parts of the State. It is
rare that the “flakiness” of the bark or a tendency to separate in
plates, is pronounced or conspicuous in our Chestnut Oak trees. The
single good example I have found is here shown in Fig. 1 reproduced
from a photograph of a specimen growing in Hayden’s ravine near
Columbus. Both trees shown are the same species but the smaller
one has merely furrowed, not flaky, bark, and it is a fair representative
of the trunks of this Oak as they occur in our vicinity. The
usual form of bark is perhaps more clearly shown in Fig. 2, which
is from a photograph of a large tree standing near the Horticultural
Hall of the Ohio State University. This specimen has leaves remarkably
narrow for Q. acuminata but the trunk is similar in
appearance to the trees which have broad leaves.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">Helianthus maximiliani.</span>—Maximilian’s Sunflower whose
habitat and range are given in Britton and Brown’s Illustrated Flora
as “on dry prairies, Minnesota, and Manitoba to the Northwest
Territory, Nebraska and Texas” may be said to be out of place in
Ohio. Yet Mr. R. F. Griggs found it (a single plant) in the season of
1900 (cf. <span class="smcap">O. S. U. Naturalist</span>, 1:16) at Sandusky, Erie County. In a
package of interesting plants sent to the State Herbarium recently
by Mr. Otto Hacker, fine herbarium specimens of this conspicuous
species were furnished. Mr. Hacker says that he observed it near
Painesville (Lake County) six or seven years ago by railway tracks,
where it is still flourishing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lotus corniculatus.</span>—This European Lotus, with such common
names as Bird’s foot, Trefoil, Ground Honeysuckle, Bloom-fell,
Crowtoes, Cat’s-clover, and Sheepfoot, was collected at Painesville
by Mr. Otto Hacker in nursery grounds. This is the second time
this waif has been recorded for Ohio, the first case being reported
by Mr. Ricksecker, of Oberlin.</p>

<p>Prof. Thomas A. Williams, editor-in-chief of the Asa Gray
Bulletin and assistant chief of the Division of Agrostology, U. S.
Department of Agriculture, died on the morning of Dec. 23, 1900.</p>


<p>At the 10th annual meeting of the Ohio State Academy of
Science, held at Columbus, on December 26 and 27, thirty-one papers
were read—12 pertaining to botany, 8 to zoology, 6 to geology, 3 to
meteorology, and 2 to anthropology. The following are the officers
for the coming year: President, August D. Selby, Wooster; 1st
Vice Pres., Rev. H. Herzer, Marietta; 2nd Vice Pres, Mrs. W. A.
Kellerman, Columbus; Secretary, E. L. Moseley, Sandusky; Treasurer,
Herbert Osborn, Columbus; members of executive committee
besides the president, secretary and treasurer, Thos. Bonser, Carey;
Lynds Jones, Oberlin; trustees, F. M. Webster, Wooster; H. C.
Beardslee, Cleveland; W. R. Lazenby, Columbus; publication committee,
F. M. Webster, Wooster; John H. Schaffner, Columbus; L.
H. McFadden, Westerville; Librarian, W. C. Mills, Columbus.</p>

<hr class="short">

<p>Since some criticism has been made, both at home and abroad,
on the name of <span class="smcap">The O. S. U. Naturalist</span>, it has been thought best
to make a slight change by dropping the words, State University.
Although a change in name is unfortunate it will not be very serious
at the present time and hereafter the name will be <span class="smcap">The Ohio
Naturalist</span>, which is perhaps more descriptive of the scope of the
journal and much better for purposes of citation.</p>

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project

1.F.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT

LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
